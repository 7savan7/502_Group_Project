# BolBachchan Language

BolBachchan is a creative, humorous programming language that blends Hindi-English keywords with traditional programming constructs. Designed to be fun and expressive, it is backed by a custom lexer and parser written in Python using PLY (Python Lex-Yacc).

## Project Purpose

To design and implement a custom programming language from scratch that supports standard programming features while incorporating Hinglish (Hindi-English) syntax.

## Features

- Primitive types: int, bool, string
- Arithmetic operators: jodo (+), ghatao (-), guna (\*), bhaag (/)
- Relational operators: badaHai (>), chhotaHai (<), barabarHai (==)
- Loops: baarBaar (for), jabTak (while)
- Conditionals: agar-toh-nahiToh (if-then-else), ternary (? :)
- Output: bolBhai() prints any data type
- Assignments: rakho keyword assigns values to variables
- Logical operators: & (and), | (or)
